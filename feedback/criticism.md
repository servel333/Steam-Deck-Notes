The Steam Deck is a wonderufl system with a lot going for it, but like all things, pros-and-cons.

## Critism

It's not a great device for people who don't have at least a little technical expertise using computers. I am a software engineer, so my level is pretty high, but my flatmate is non-technical and some of the pain-points below have been quite challenging for him.

- **Some games are HUGE** and may take up a lot of space. 100GB+ is pretty common for big title AAA games. Highly recommend planning on buying the biggest and fastest Micro-SD card you can get. Updates can be quite large as well.
  - I (Servel333) got the **SanDisk 1TB Extreme microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card SDSQXA1-1T00-GN6MA**.
  - I would recommend SanDisk, Samsung
  - Pay attention to read-write speeds. This will impact load and save times.
- **The shader cache takes up a LOT of space** for some games.
  - If you have the 64GB model, expect to have to move this folder to the SD card so it doesn't fill up your internal drive.
- The Steam Deck is completely off when in sleep mode, which is great for battery life, but this also means **it won't download updates while it's in sleep mode**.
  - Be sure to check for updates and downlaod them before you run out the door or are planning to play something specific with friends.
- There are some very popular titles **that still will not work on the Steam Deck**. The biggest pain seems to be anti-cheat software that some game studios require, and that don't run well on Unix. Some titles may never make it to working on the Steam Deck.
  - Make sure to check the specific titles you are looking foward to playing before you buy.
- **Sometiems the game will crash, sometiems games do weird things, sometiems the system will crash, sometimes you have to fiddle with the Proton settings or controller layout to get things working**. It's not 100% stable yet, so expect some troubleshooting to get things running smoothly.
- Configuring the controller is very well done and simple **but only for assigning a single button to a single input**. As soon as you have to configure a Steam Deck button to press two keys in sequence or at the same time, figuring out how to set that up is confusing at best. The configuration layers is also great, but also quite confusing to setup.

### 3rd party tools

- Setting up non-Steam titles and stores is possible, but note that it is not always easy.
- This is a great system for emulation, and if you have experience setting-up emulators, you won't have much problem here, but that doesn't mean it's easy or strightforward. It's not for those who are less technical.

## Feedback

- Steam really needs to add the option to let it download and install updates while it is in sleep mode and plugged in. This could save a lot of headache for users who want a 'it just works' experience, and to have games ready to play all the time.
- Smarter conflict detection on save game conflicts would help a lot. New users have lost save games because of the confusing save game conflict experience.
- A game configuration database would be relly helpful for us end users, just like there is a controller configuration database.
- More help messages in the controller configuration screens would be really helpful.
