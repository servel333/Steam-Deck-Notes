[EmuDeck](https://www.emudeck.com/) is a tool that makes it easier to install video game emulators for playing your retro game ROMs. It does require some know-how to get boot images, ROMs, and other things set up, so it's still not quite for beginners, but there are tutorials on the website that will be very helpful.

> Play all your retro games

> We take care of everything, RetroArch Configuration, Bezels, Gamepad Configuration for Gamecube, Wii, etc.

- Note, the installation requires closing steam at one point. Please [read the instructions](https://www.emudeck.com/#how_to_install)

## Notes

- I chose advanced install, and installed to my SD card, everything else default (Aug 22 2022)

```
Yuzu is not configured
You need to copy your Keys and firmware to: 
/run/media/mmcblk0p1/Emulation/bios/yuzu/keys
/run/media/mmcblk0p1/Emulation/biosyuzu/firmware

Make sure to copy your files inside the folders. Do not overwrite them
```

```
Done!

Remember to add your games here:
/run/media/mmcblk0p1/Emulation/roms
And your Bios (PS1, PS2, Yuzu, Ryujinx) here:
/run/media/mmcblk0p1/Emulation/bios

Open Steam Rom Manager on your Desktop to add your games to your SteamUI
Interface.

There is a bug in RetroArch that if you are using Bezels you can not set save
configuration files unless you close your current game. Use overrides for your
custom configurations or use expert mode to disabled them

If you encounter any problem please visit our Discord:

To Update EmuDeck in the future, just run this App again.

Enjoy!
